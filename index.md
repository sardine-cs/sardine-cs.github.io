## About Me

I'm currently a **graduate student** at [**Instituto Superior Técnico**](https://deec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en), University of Lisbon, supervised by [**André F.T. Martins**](https://andre-martins.github.io/). My research revolves around the study of hallucinations and failure modes in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), automatic evaluation for machine translation, and interpretability of models of language. 

During my masters, I did research on Nonlinear Control for Automatic Flight Control at Instituto Superior Técnico.
